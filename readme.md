Maven Archetype to create an Ant-based Maven Plugin
====================================================

Current status
--------------
Initial commit, no property substitution, no testing, no documentation

I'd be surprised if it built at this stage

groupId
-------
Now I'm being slightly rude by using the apache groupId, hopefully they'll pick this up and integrate it.

artifactId
-----------
How does it sound? I'm trying to follow the pattern of the existing Apache Maven archetypes...

please comment at [the forum](https://github.com/genthaler/maven-archetype-ant-plugin/issues)

Real Ant-based plugins
----------------------
Some of the integration tests will create actual usable plugins, which perhaps should also go into Central
